<p>What is EQ?</p>
<p>Emotional intelligence a.k.a: street smarts. Accepting ourselves, thoughts, feelings, working through and with them</p><br>

<p>How is EQ different from IQ?</p>
<p>IQ is cognitive/intellectual intelligence a.k.a: book smarts</p><br>

<p>Why is EQ important?</p>
<p>Reducing the risk of falling into psychological traps of the illusions of our own mind. Staying/living in the moment. 
Challenging the age-old trope of nature vs nurture. Being aware of, experiencing the full range of human emotions. 
Acceptance of and working through feelings rather than trying to be happy.
Living a rich, full, meaningful and enjoyable life while effectively handling worries and difficulties that inevitively occur. 
When we take action on things that truly matter to us our lives become rich, full and meaningful.</p>


<p>The human mind analyses, plans, creates and communicates. Our minds have evolved to help us survive in the world, avoid harm and reproduce.
Being part of a group, comparing yourself with others and fitting in. Rejection, comparrison and impossible self-standards. Wanting more and chasing happiness, 
which leads to unhelpful thoughts and beliefs. The harder we chase pleasurable things the more likely we are to suffer</p>
