      <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
      <h5>Date: 9 September 2022</h5>
      </div>
  
      <div class = "p-1">

<p>Long-term goal/career pathway:</p>

<p>Goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>Become a junior web developer</li>
<li>Get a job as a junior web developer</li>
<li>Work seriously hard & learn an enormous amount in a relatively short period</li>
</ul><br>

<p>Career change: a move away from nursing, more mentally, emotionally and physically sustainable work over the long-term</p><br>

<p>Strengths & limitations:</p>

<p>Strengths:</p>

<p>Consistent, (doggedly)Determined, Organised, on-time, punctual, good communication, considerate, logical, flexible, reliable, good at creating a plan</p>

<p>Limitations:</p>

<p>Relatively slow learner, always have been, takes me ages to understand a concept, working through and completing a plan in a timely manner </p><br>

<p>Core/human skills to develop:</p>

<p>Time-management, being assertive</p><br>

<p>Workload: how will I manage?:</p>

<p>Work productively, safely with learners, facilitators, industry, community:</p>

<p>As a nurse I’m well practiced at working with sensitive information, the legal and ethical considerations involved</p><br>

<p>How do I cope with stress?</p>

<p>I’m good at taking short breaks, going for walks/getting outside, sleeping a bit longer if I need to, staying in touch with friends/family, I have many interests</p><br>

<p>How will I seek help in a timely fashion?:</p>

<p>I tend to work on something, trying all ideas I can think of before seeking help. I write things down when I think of them and try them later etc. I like to try and work through a problem logically myself before seeking help. I think it’s a good way to learn.</p><br>

<p>What do I expect from the facilitators?:</p>

<p>Help/advice when I need it. I tend to only ask for help when I’m truly stuck on a problem. I’ll also tend to still try and work through an issue myself with the facilitators</p><br>

<p>Scheduling:</p>

<p>Apart from a brief/surprise trip to Australia in mid-September I have cleared my schedule for Dev Academy. That’s how much I want to succeed at this course</p>
