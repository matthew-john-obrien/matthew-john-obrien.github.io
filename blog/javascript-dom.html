    <p>JS, HTML & CSS:</p>
    <p>Imagine that you wanted a new car, but you wanted a special car, a one off
      all of your own design. What might you need to do to get what you want? 
      Well you'd need a team of planners, designers and builders to get the 
      job done. In a similar way you need a team to build web programs, a team
      of coding languages, which work together to give you what you want.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/car-blueprints.png" alt="Blueprints" style=width:100px;height:80px>
    <p>HTML is the planning phase, the components needed, the structure, the
      blueprints
    </p>
    <img src="/images/car-mechanic.png" alt="Mechanic" style=width:100px;height:100px>
    <p>CSS is the design phase of the project, design of components, styling
      the interior and exterior, choosing the colours.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/car.png" alt="Car" style=width:100px;height:70px>
    <p>JS is the working model, starting the engine, putting the car in gear,
      putting your foot on the accelerator, going 0-100 in 3.0s flat. It's 
      dynamic and interactive. The working model and the user experience.
    </p>

    <p>Flow & Loops:</p>
    <p>When you accalerate you move through the gears in sequential order in 
      a similar way to how a computer runs code from top to bottom. This is
      control flow. The computer runs the code from the first to the last line 
      of code in the execution flow of of the program.</p>
      <img src="/images/car-gearshift.png" alt="Gears" style=width:100px;height:100px>


    <p>Within control flow many tasks are performed. Loops are one type of such
      task. A loop repeats actions one or any number of
      times as required depending upon the provided conditions. Different 
      mechanisms determine the start and end points. When accalerating we 
      start at first gear, move through second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth. Then
      our loop ends until the loop is called on again. There are many types of loops,
      but for now we are going to concentrate on only the "for" loop</p>

    <p>The DOM:</p>
    <p>When building a car there is a head honcho who runs the show, this is
      DOM. The Document Object Model (DOM) is the overarching document that
      combines everything together and allows program languages to interact.
      The DOM is like a family tree with the DOM at the head of the family and 
      all its relations beneath it. The DOM provides JS, HTML & CSS a place to
      come together and interact.
    </p>

    <p>Objects & Arrays</p>
    <p>Objects can be used to store a collection of data rather than a single
      value or be anything that can be defined by a set of charatcteristics. 
      A car is an object with many characteristics e.g. doors, pedals, paintjob etc.
      In objects characteristics are known as properties, which consist of keys 
      and values.</p>
      <img src="/images/object-example.png" alt="Objects" style=width:50px;height:30px>


    <p>Arrays can be used to store a list of values and are especially useful
      when wanting to create oredered lists where items can be accessed by their
      numerical position in a list. Arrays use zero indexing, which means the 
      first item in an array starts at zero, the second item is 1, the third 2
      and so on. Both objects and arrays are whats called mutable, which means their
      values can be changed.</p>

    <p>Functions</p>
    <p>Functions allow you to define a block of code, name it and execute it
      as many times as required to get the desired result. A function can 
      contain one or many parameters, which can be of any data type.
