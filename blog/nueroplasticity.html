    <h2>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h2><br>

      <p>Neuroplasticity:</p>
      <p>Until relatively recently medicine and science believed that brain anatomy and capacity was hardwired, fixed and couldn’t be developed. The belief was that the brain changed after childhood only through the long process of decline. When brain cells failed to develop, were injured or died they could no longer be replaced. Nor could the brain alter its structure or find a new way to function when damaged.</p>
      
      <p>It is now believed that the brain changes itself with each new and different activity it performs, perfecting its connections so that it improves with each task at hand. If certain parts fail others can sometimes take over. The brain is changeable, malleable and modifiable.</p>
      
      <p>These new notions have helped people realise that they are not necessarily stuck with the mental abilities they thought they were born with. That if they think, learn and practice they can shape their brains and behaviour.</p>
      
      <p>Neuroplasticity & I:</p>
      <p>In reflecting on neuroplasticity I realise that I can challenge myself at any age to learn something new. That my learning journey is about me and my ability to develop new skills is more about my willingness to think, learn, practice and repeat than inate characteristics.</p>
       
      <p>Neuroplasticity development:</p>
      <p>Practice, practice, practice and more practice. Memory games and tasks e.g. quizzes, crosswords, sudoku. Learning a new physical skill e.g. juggling, instrument. Learning a new language e.g. JavaScript, exercise.</p>

      <p>Growth Mindset:</p>
      <p>Growth mindset challenges whether we believe our abilities can be developed or are fixed. It posits that a person’s true potential is unknown and unknowable, that it’s impossible to forsee what can be accomplished through years of passion, toil and experience.</p>
      
      <p>People who cultivate a growth mindset believe that intelligence and creativity can be developed with repetition and experience. They are less likely to be discouraged by failure because they reframe challenges as learning opportunities.</p>
      
      <p>Growth Mindset reflection:</p>
      <p>I’ve studied neuroplasticity in the past, not so much growth mindset. I have for a long time thought I have a brain that can change itself or be changed through my own small, repetitive actions. That I can learn new skills through application and experience.</p>
      
      <p>Growth mindset and learning journey:</p>
      <p>With regards to my learning journey I think I need to continue on the path of knowing I have much to learn to become a junior web developer, that I have just begun to scratch the surface of my potential going forward and that every aspect of my current study is an opportunity to learn and develop. It is about my learning and competing with myself to get better rather than comparing myself to others.</p>

      <p>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset in relation to Learning Plan & Strategy:</p>
      <p>My father used to remind me when I was stryggling to learn something that the man who never made a mistake never learned anything. I need to keep reminding myself that I'm on mt own learning journey, try not to compare myself to others and recognise that everyone else is on their own learning journey. I need to continue to recognise the areas I have strengths, weaknesses and look at those as opportunities for contunued learning. Afterall I'm competing with myself and no one else. </p><br>
