      Three things I learned about myself and my ego during core learning:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I like working in my own head space, but also like collaborating with others.
      </li>
      <li>
        I prefer to give things a really good go before I look for help.
      </li>
      <li>
        I’m reluctant to post my work on discord for everyone to see as I know 
        my understanding of code concepts is relatively lacking e.g. I often try to
        use innerHTML in the wrong situations.</li>
    </ul><br>

    <p>
      The role of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming:
    </p>

    <p>
      Working with people one needs to be aware of where others might be coming from. 
      We all have different life journeys and being able to put oneself in others shoes 
      and consider what their perspective might be is important for effective 
      collaboration.
    </p><br>

    <p>
      That which surprised me most about core learning:
    </p>

    <p> 
      That it’s considered to be such an important part of being  a programmer. 
      Personal skills are such an important part of any working situation, but I 
      would have imagined considered less so in the tech environment.
    </p><br>

    <p>
      Most challenging aspects of core learning:
    </p>

    <p>
      Listening and looping. Getting onto a link and practicing listening to someone f
      or a couple of minutes, attempting to reflect and having them do the same. It 
      was especially challenging if attempting to loop with someone who didn’t appear 
      to understand the exercise or take it seriously. 
    </p><br>

    <p>
      Why Dev Academy focuses so much on core learning:
    </p>

    <p>
      On bootcamp we will be working in an environment where we are forced to 
      collaborate with others whether we like it or not. We will all bring different 
      skills into that mix of people. Some of us will already be relatively skilled 
      programmers, others will be better people persons, others good problem solvers 
      rather than programmers. We all need to collaborate as a team to solve problems. 
      Our interpersonal skills and collaboration abilities will be majorly put to the 
      test.
    </p><br>

    <p>
      Core learning useful or a waste of time:
    </p>

    <p>
      I think the core exercises have helped me realise that through my previous 
      experience as a nurse I developed some quite good core skills, particularly when 
      doing the looping exercises. Learning to listen, reflect and empathise is at the 
      core of good nursing. It appears that it might be at the core of good programming 
      as well.
